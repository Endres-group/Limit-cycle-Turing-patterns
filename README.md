# How nature discovers rare Turing islands: exploration by common limit cycles
### This repository contains Jupyter notebooks to simulate the paper.

***

### Organisation:
Each file contains the code to simulate the data, and generate visualisations from them. The code is annotated to guide the user, as a tutorial.
- `Figure_2.jpynb` - SEF visualisation. Figure 2 data simulation and visualisation.
- `Figure_3.jpynb` - Discovery of Turing islands. Figure 3 data simulation and visualisation, alongside SFig 1,2,8.
- `Figure_4.jpynb` - Reproducibility of Turing patterns. Figure 4 data simulation and visualisation, alongside SFig 3
- `Figure_5.jpynb` - Enhanced reproducibility through French flag gradients. Figure 5 data simulation and visualisation, alongside SFig 7
- `Supplementary_figure_dimensionality.jpynb` - Effect of dimensionality on limit cycle coupled Turing patterns. SFig 4,5
- `Supplementary_figure_multistability.jpynb` - Effect of multistability within the system. SFig 6

Requirements:
- Python 3.9 or higher, 8 CPUs and occasionally GPUs
